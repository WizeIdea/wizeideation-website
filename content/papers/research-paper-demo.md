# Introduction

This is a **demo** research paper used to verify that the dynamic route generation works.
It contains a few headings, a code block, and a simple table so we can see the markdown-to-HTML pipeline in action.

## Sample Code

```python
def align_signal(text):
    # placeholder function for stylometric alignment
    return text.upper()
```

## Sample Table

| Token | Frequency |
|-------|----------:|
| the   |       124 |
| and   |        97 |
| of    |        85 |

> The goal of the forensic-stylometric pipeline is to turn noisy human writing into a **sovereign signal**.
