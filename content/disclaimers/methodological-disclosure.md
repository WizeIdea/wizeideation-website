This manuscript was prepared within an author-directed research workflow incorporating generative language models as part of the drafting support and analytical review process. The author originated the conceptual outline, theoretical positions, and interpretive arguments.

Generative AI systems were employed to assist with structural articulation, syntactic variation, and linguistic coherence checks against the author's analytical frameworks.

All substantive judgments, evaluative conclusions, and final formulations are the author's own. No utilised systems operated autonomously or contributed independent authorship, and the process remained under continuous human supervision.
